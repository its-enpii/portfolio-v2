## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This portfolio uses a cosmic metaphor where each celestial body represents different aspects of professional and personal identity:

### 🌞 The Sun — Myself
*Dark blue, calm in the void*  
The center of this universe. Its light is soft, not burning—only nurturing. A constant presence that gives meaning to all orbits around it.

### 🪐 The Inner Planet — Family
*Closest to the light, warm but stable*  
The planet nearest to the sun, where all orbits begin. The foundation that provides direction and the first lessons in navigation through life.

### 🌕 The Moon — Skills
*A small light in quiet orbit*  
Revolving steadily, marking each skill that grows from stillness. Where ideas and precision combine, forming a harmony of curiosity and perseverance.

### 🌍 The Living Planet — Projects
*A trail of light in the dark sky*  
Evidence that something was once created. Each project is a fleeting moment, but leaves a flame that won't easily be extinguished—proof of creation and impact.

### 🌑 The Distant Planet — Contact
*Spinning furthest from the light*  
Once closer, now gravity no longer holds it near. They pass silently, carrying remnants of light that once lingered, representing connections that shift over time.

### ✨ Stars and Comets
*Thousands of points adorning boundless space*  
Some merely pass by, others linger for a moment. Comets come and go, fleeting but leaving trails of light that persist longer than their presence.

### 🪨 Asteroid Belt
*At the edge of the galaxy*  
Dark rocks rotating faithfully in their paths. Fragments of the past that remain, harmless but never completely lost—memories and experiences that orbit quietly.

### 🌠 The Infinite Canvas
*In the vast silence, everything finds its place*  
Not to compete with the light, but to keep spinning—quiet, purposeful, and complete. Each element exists in harmony with the void, creating meaning through presence rather than dominance.
